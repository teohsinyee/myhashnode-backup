During my fourth year of studies, I had the pleasure of taking a course taught by a brilliant and unconventional professor. Instead of sticking to the textbook, the good doctor shared fascinating tidbits of information that weren't found in any of our assigned readings. Even months after completing the course, I found myself constantly applying these nuggets of knowledge to my daily life.

So, I decided to compile some of the most interesting and useful insights I learned from that course and categorize them into sections that cover advice, interesting facts, myths, news, and new vocabulary.

## Interesting Myths

*Debunk common myths related to the topic of the course, and provide factual information.*

1. **Japanese working ethic**
    
    * Myth: Always work & work?
        
        While it is true that Japan has a strong work ethic and a culture of long work hours, it is important to note that there are also movements to address this issue, such as the "work-style reform" initiative launched by the Japanese government in 2016 to promote work-life balance.
        
    * Myth: Commit suicide place is provided?  
        While there have been reports of "suicide forests" in Japan, it is not accurate to say that suicide places are provided. The issue of suicide in Japan is complex and has multiple contributing factors, such as social pressure and mental health stigma.
        
    * Myth: Due to the decrease in population, government provides free housing?  
        While the Japanese government has implemented various policies to address the aging population issue, such as promoting immigration and encouraging childbirth, it is not accurate to say that free housing is provided in a particular village for aged people.  
        However, there are programs that offer financial support and subsidies for senior citizens to help them with housing and other living expenses.
        
    * Myth: Some Japanese hardly accept foreigners?  
        While Japan has been criticized for its homogeneity and the challenges faced by foreigners in terms of language and cultural barriers, it is not accurate to say that the culture hardly accepts foreigners.  
        There are many foreigners who have lived and worked in Japan for extended periods of time and have found success and fulfillment in their experiences.
        
2. Which country got the best doctor?
    
    * India is very good in x-ray, and medical field, got the best doctor?  
        While India has made significant progress in the field of medical technology and healthcare, it is not accurate to say that it has the best doctors or is the best in every aspect of the medical field.  
        It is important to recognize the strengths and limitations of different healthcare systems and to promote collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise.
        
3. Why is so pleasant to work with Japanese?
    
    * Japanese is particular in planning?  
        While it is true that the Japanese have a reputation for being meticulous and detail-oriented, it is important to recognize that not all Japanese individuals or companies operate in the same way. It is also important to be aware of cultural differences and to communicate effectively to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.
        
4. Malaysia professor made RM 20k per month?
    
    * While it is true that some professors in Malaysia may earn high salaries, it is important to note that this is not representative of all professors and that salaries can vary widely depending on factors such as experience, qualifications, and field of expertise.
        
5. Senior lecturers in Malaysia may receive RM 6k month after retirement?
    
    * While it is true that some senior lecturers in Malaysia may receive retirement benefits, it is important to note that this is not the case for all lecturers and that there are many factors that contribute to the hiring practices of universities and other educational institutions.

1. There is a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/umptrollz/) that criticizes UMP policies:
    
    * Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) is a public university located in Pahang, Malaysia. The Facebook page mentioned in the blog is a **critical commentary on UMP's policies and management**, and may not necessarily reflect the views of the university or its stakeholders.
        
2. In supply chain management, producing everything in-house can be much more expensive, which is why some products, like Apple's, are expensive.
    
    * Supply chain refers to the process of getting goods or services from the manufacturer to the end consumer. Apple is known for its high-end and expensive products, such as iPhones and MacBooks. One reason for this is that **Apple does not produce all the components**.
        
3. FedEx has a policy of avoiding left turns on delivery routes, and instead mainly turns right, to save time and fuel.
    
    * FedEx typically avoids making left turns on delivery routes, according to [**CNN**](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/16/world/ups-trucks-no-left-turns/index.html). This is because **turning left can be more time-consuming and dangerous,** so they rely on right turns instead. The same goes for UPS and USPS. If you're interested in how these companies plan their delivery routes, you can check out this [**article**](https://www.upperinc.com/blog/how-ups-fedex-usps-plan-their-delivery-routes/).
        
4. Dell/Lenovo allows for laptop customization, but it can be time-consuming.

6. 3D printers are affordable and so are the materials, but producing certain items may not be cost-efficient.
    
    * 3D printing is a manufacturing technology that allows for the creation of three-dimensional objects from digital designs. While 3D printers themselves may have become more affordable over the years, the **cost of materials used in 3D printing can still be quite expensive, especially for larger or more complex objects.** Therefore, 3D printing may not always be the most cost-efficient manufacturing method.
        
7. IBM sold Thinkpad to Lenovo
    
    * IBM is a multinational technology company that was once known for its line of ThinkPad laptops. In 2005, IBM sold its personal computer division, including the ThinkPad brand, to Lenovo, a Chinese technology company. This was seen as a pivotal moment in the technology industry, as it marked a shift in the dominance of American technology companies to Asian ones. Additionally, **Lenovo's CEO at the time of the acquisition, Yang Yuanqing, had a non-IT background**, which was seen as a departure from the traditional CEO profile of technology companies. This highlights the importance of having a diverse set of skills and experiences in leadership positions, even in the technology industry.
        
8. UMT has a robotics lab because it is a technical university, whereas USM does not have one
    
    * Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) is a technical university located in Terengganu, Malaysia. It is known for its expertise in marine and aquatic studies, as well as environmental and engineering research. As a technical university, UMT has invested in various facilities and resources to support research and development in fields such as robotics.
        
    * Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), on the other hand, is a research university located in Penang, Malaysia. While USM also offers courses in engineering and technology, it may not have as much emphasis on robotics research and development compared to UMT.

## New Vocabulary

1. **Bullwhip effect**: This is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in consumer demand can cause increasingly larger swings in inventory and production further upstream in the supply chain.
    
    For example, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in demand for certain products, such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies, which caused panic buying and hoarding by consumers. This sudden increase in demand caused a ripple effect through the supply chain, as retailers ordered more from their distributors, who in turn ordered more from their manufacturers, and so on. This led to stockouts and shortages at various points in the supply chain, even though there was no actual shortage of the products themselves. The bullwhip effect amplified the fluctuations in demand and led to inefficiencies in the supply chain.
    
2. **Coerce**: To use force or threats to make someone do something against their will.
    
    For example, a boss might coerce an employee into working overtime by threatening to fire them if they refuse.
    
3. **Normative**: Refers to social norms and values that are widely accepted and considered standard within a particular society or group.
    
    For example, recycling has become a normative behavior in many countries, and people who don't recycle are often viewed as irresponsible or selfish.
    
4. **Mimetic**: The act of copying or imitating someone or something else.
    
    For example, a new business might imitate the branding or marketing strategies of a more established company in order to gain a competitive edge.
    
5. **Efficiency deficiency**: This term refers to a situation where a system or process is designed to be efficient, but fails to achieve its intended goals due to some underlying inefficiency or bottleneck.
    
    For example, a hospital might implement a new electronic medical records system to improve efficiency, but if the system is poorly designed or not user-friendly, it could actually slow down doctors and nurses, making patient care less efficient overall.
