> Death does not discriminate, whether saints or sinners, in the end, all are equal.

These aren’t exact words from anyone I’ve known, but a sentiment that resonates deeply with me, especially after the events of early 2024.

**A Series of Partings**

It began with the passing of my grandmother, a sad but expected part of life's natural cycle. But then, the dominoes continued to fall - my friend's grandmother passed away, **a younger friend** was suddenly claimed by a car accident, and **a caring and athletic pastor**, [Pr. Timothy](https://www.faithour.com/timothy-loh/) died unexpectedly at 57.

**Life’s Uncertain, So I Made Changes**

Previously, I equated death with old age, imagining it typically follows a long illness where one fades in a hospital bed. But these losses unveiled a different reality: <mark>death is unpredictable and can claim anyone, anytime, regardless of their health or goodness.</mark> This was a jarring revelation that prompted a shift in how I view my existence and prioritize my time.

**Returning to Roots**

Driven by these events, I went back to my hometown, more than 200 kilometers away, and choosing to spend over a week there. I took on familial responsibilities, helping around the house, taking care of pets, and guiding my younger siblings towards independence. This wasn’t just a retreat but an attempt to reinforce the family's safety net.

### **Preparing for the Inevitable**

Most people avoid talking about death, but after seeing how sudden it can be, I got my things in order. I talked to my parents about my insurance, made sure they knew where my important papers were, and started a checklist for what should be done if I pass away unexpectedly. In case something happens to me, my family will not be left in a financial or emotional mess.

### **Living Simply and Purposefully**

Clarity often comes from grief. The loss clarified for me what truly matters—people, not possessions; experiences, not accolades. Simplifying my life to focus on these priorities became not just a desire but a need. This wasn’t about preparing for death, but about making the most of life.

### **Thoughts on Mortality and Connection**

As I write this, there are reports of continuous earthquakes in Taiwan, where several of my colleagues are based. This has me worried about their safety, and it’s a reminder of how we’re all connected, no matter the distance.

**Looking Forward With a Changed Perspective**

If the first quarter of 2024 has taught me anything, it’s that <mark>life is unpredictably short</mark>. I’ve learned to appreciate my loved ones more, prepare for the unexpected better, and focus on truly living each day to its fullest.

**Final Thoughts**

I’ve probably not been perfect in the past; I’ve hurt people, sometimes without realizing it. Writing this has made me reflect on those moments, and I’m sorry for them. I hope to do better, moving forward with a kind heart and a clear mind.

Life’s tough lessons are perhaps the most potent catalyst for change.

As Sadhguru wisely said,

> As life is, death is. The awareness of this fact allows you to live life fully and intensely.
