### 1-day before:

1. **Research the Company**: Before your first day, research the company you'll be interning for. Read their website, follow their social media pages, and look up recent news articles about the company. Understanding the company's mission, values, and culture will help you feel more prepared and confident on your first day. 🔎🔎
    
2. **Get Your Attire Ready**: Choose your attire for the first day and make sure it's clean and ironed. Check with the HR department to confirm the dress code. The attire might range from smart casual to formal. You want to make a good first impression and dressing professionally is always a safe bet. 👚👚
    
3. **Plan Your Transport**: Confirm the company's location and plan your transport to arrive on time. Consider leaving a little early to account for any unexpected delays. Being punctual is an essential part of making a good impression. 🚗
    
4. **Prepare Questions**: Make a list of questions you have about the company, your role, and what you'll be doing during your internship. This will help you stay focused and show your eagerness to learn.🤔🙋‍♂️
    
5. **Sleep Early**: Getting a good night's sleep is crucial to being alert and focused during your first day. Ensure you have enough sleep to be energetic and fresh for your first day. 💚
    

### On the D-Day:

1. **Arrive on Time:** Arrive at least 10-15 minutes early, so you have time to settle down and collect yourself. This also shows that you're responsible and eager to start your internship.
    
2. **Bring a Notebook and Pen**: Bring a notebook and pen to take notes during orientation or any meetings. This will show your readiness to learn and your interest in the company. 📝📝
    
3. **Practice Good Body Language**: Stand tall, smile, and make eye contact with others. Good body language shows your confidence, professionalism, and interest in the company. Even if you're feeling nervous, a smile can go a long way in making a positive first impression. 😀😀
