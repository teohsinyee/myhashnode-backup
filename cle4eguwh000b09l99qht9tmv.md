# From Regrets to Growth in my 23

Do you ever find yourself reflecting on your past and feeling a sense of regret? We've all been there. But what if I told you that your regrets could be a valuable tool for personal growth? That's what I've come to realize as I reflect on my own life.

In this article, I want to share my journey from regrets to growth and how I've learned to prioritize my goals, reflect on my progress, and delay gratification. I'll be honest, it hasn't been an easy journey, but I've learned a lot along the way, and I hope my experience can help others.

I've personally experienced **three types of regrets**, and each one has taught me an important lesson:  
\- regret of doing wrong things  
\- regret of not doing things  
\- regret of not doing the right things.

In my early years of college, I was advised by a successful entrepreneur to focus solely on my career progression rather than contributing to others. Unfortunately, **I didn't take this advice** and instead spent too much time on helping others rather than myself. Looking back, I realized that I could have achieved more if I had prioritized my career goals.

Similarly, when I joined university, a lecturer advised me to not be too active in clubs and activities. But, being young and eager, **I did the opposite** and ended up stretching myself too thin. As a result, I wasn't able to devote enough time to my studies, and my health suffered. ❌❌

It wasn't until my senior year that I finally took the advice of my seniors and focused on sharpening my technical skills. This allowed me to stand out from my peers and led to a range of job opportunities. However, I regret **not starting sooner**, as I could have been even more successful in my chosen field. ❌❌

My journey towards personal growth continued through my early twenties. I was approached by several companies for job opportunities, but I rejected all of them due to a full plate of commitments. Looking back, I realize that I **missed out on valuable opportunities** because I was not able to prioritize my goals effectively. ❌❌

As I approach graduation from university, I am taking a hard look at the skillset that I have and how ready I am to step into the industry. It's not an easy task, but I am committed to reflecting on my progress, prioritizing my goals, and taking care of myself. 💪💪💖

As I close this article, I want to leave you with this thought: life is too short to live with regrets. We all make mistakes, but it's what we do with those mistakes that truly matters. Instead of dwelling on our past regrets, let's learn from them, prioritize our goals, and work towards personal growth. 🌈🌈

Remember, achieving our goals is not always easy. It takes hard work, dedication, and a willingness to delay gratification. But the reward is worth it: a fulfilling life free of regret.

So, whether you're just starting out in your career or you're further along, take the time to reflect on your past, prioritize your goals, and work towards personal growth. And always remember that regrets can be an essential tool for personal growth, as long as we're willing to learn from them and move forward.

> Together, let's transform our regrets into a powerful force for positive change and personal growth. Let's live a life that we can be proud of, free of regret, and full of joy. The journey won't be easy, but it will be worth it.
