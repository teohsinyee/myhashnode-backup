# Revision Techniques That Are Proven to Work! (Computer Science)

During my fourth year at university, I finally discovered the study techniques that work best for me. 🥳🥳

The approaches that I've tried:

* Flashcard using [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/latest)
    
* Summarize the notes
    
* Study group
    

I even interviewed a few top students and tried their study techniques. 👇😂  
(If you know her? XD)

**But it did not work quite well for me. ❌😂**

One day, I got bored while studying Supply Chain Management and decided to watch a few YouTube videos for fun. To my surprise, the video scenes stuck in my brain more than the lecture notes did, and I realized I am a visual learner. 😎😎

### Here's how I knew that this study technique was working for me:

* I could understand the concepts easily
    
* I could recall the information during exams
    
* I could explain the topics to others without difficulty
    
* It sparked my curiosity to learn more about the subject
    
* I enjoyed the whole process
    

I used this technique for two courses: AKP402 Operations Management, which was a minor course under Management, and CPC453 Computer Vision & Robotics, a mandatory course for AI students. The study techniques I used have **proven to work** after sitting the exam a few days ago. 🥳

### AKP402 Operations Management 💴

* This course required us to know the latest news to answer open-ended questions, which made it dry and difficult. 👻👻
    
* I created a tailored [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLubc-EUh5LYLsHV5VAbNZNkm62iUl__w7) to make it more interesting and engaging.📽️
    
* I also used ChatGPT to generate possible exam questions and get feedback on my answers.
    

### CPC453 Computer Vision & Robotics 🤖

* This course is mandatory for AI students but doesn't have a physical robot to work with. 😵😵
    
* I created another tailored [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLubc-EUh5LYL7dLNJFpaKInyP_CBs4Gjc) to better understand the concepts. 📽️
    
* I also used ChatGPT to generate practice exam questions and get feedback on my answers.
    

### Use ChatGPT to generate possible exam questions

1\] Feed in your course outlines & lecture note outlines to ChatGPT

2\] This is the prompt that I used: `Create a few case study questions based on the syllabus. it's my final year exam. 50 marks per question. each question will have several sub questions from different chapter.`

3\] I would answer the questions and then ChatGPT would critique my answers and provide feedback. This helped me fill in the knowledge gaps and **realize my blind spots**. ✅

4\] Sometimes it could be a bit funny. Like chicken talks to duck. 👇👇 😂😂 All you need to do is to paste your question there, rather than ask Chatbot gives your the answers for questions 'above'. **It is confused by 'above'** and started to bully us.

### Limitation of ChatGPT

It's pretty weak in the calculation. It might give you different answers to the same calculation question. 😂🧮🧮

### Ultimate revision formula 😲😲

1. Write down everything that I have learnt in 1 paper & link each topic together (Put a question mark in my brain)
    
2. Quickly go through the notes that I wrote during lecture
    
3. Watch videos (Increase my dopamine level)
    
4. Attempt case study questions (ChatGPT will cosplay as lecturer to mark my answer) 👩‍🏫👩‍🏫
    
5. Scan through all the lecture notes again
    
    * Don't miss any single detail! Normally exam questions will be the one that you skipped!! 😂😂 IT'S A CURSE XD
        
    * I used Notion to track the topics that I've covered & put a flag 🚩 on topics that I'm reading

6. Read the case studies & examples in textbook
    
7. Sleep early 🛌😴
    
8. Wake up early & listen to music & sing (No longer refer to any notes) 🎶🎧🎸
    
    * **Please maintain a good mood!!!** Have peace of mind :D
        
9. Step into the exam hall confidently 😀😀(Understand that purpose of exam is to test our understanding of certain topics)
    

In addition, I didn't print out any handouts but would draw on paper if I needed to visualize concepts or calculations. Instead of memorizing formulas, I would derive the equation and understand the logic behind it.

A professor once said to me, "Learning is fun. Fun is learning." I couldn't agree more. I learned that everyone has a different way of doing revision, and it's important to <mark>keep experimenting to find out what works best for you</mark>.
