Meet Meow Meow (aka Miao Miao) - my gentle, sheep-like dog with a coat of pure white fur and big, round eyes. We rescued her injured in 2006, struggling to catch this timid creature at first. But Meow Meow soon became a regular for meals, and one rainy night roaming the streets, we knew she was meant to be part of our family. Unlike her feline-inspired name implied, Meow Meow never barked aggressively, bit or caused a fuss with anyone.

In 2024, our beloved Meow Meow left this world. Caring for her in her final phase was one of the most profound experiences I've ever had - one I'm compelled to share.

### What Happened as Her Health Declined?

As Meow Meow aged, we grappled with:

* **Breathing Problems**: Her lungs filled with fluid, and she needed medicine every day.
    
* **Weak Heart**: Her heart wasn't as strong as it used to be, making every heartbeat hard.
    
* **Hearing and Vision Loss**: Meow Meow couldn’t hear and had trouble seeing because of cataracts, making her depend more on us to get around and understand what was happening.
    
* **Leg Issues**: It was tough for her to walk; she needed our help just to stand up.
    
* **Nighttime Restlessness**: Dementia made her restless at night, barking and walking around. We took turns staying up with her to keep her calm.
    
* **Eating Difficulties**: Loss of appetite leading to dehydration and a need for frequent vet visits and drip feeding. While we tried homecooked meals, she preferred outside, seasoned foods - the vet advised letting her eat her favorite treats in this final stage.
    

### How Did We Prepare for the Inevitable?

Three months before she passed, we researched pet funeral services, comparing crematoriums and packages. We selected one offering an individual Taoist ceremony with recitation, casket, and the option to scatter her ashes in a river per my family's spiritual beliefs.

Having this plan allowed us to face the inevitable with the dignity Meow Meow deserved, rather than make rash, frantic decisions later. We didn't have to rush - we could help her settle peacefully.

### What Was That Final Goodbye Like?

For months, we frequently checked to ensure she was still breathing while sleeping. One afternoon, we all surrounded her as she slipped away.

The funeral service swiftly arrived, and as we waited, we gently positioned Meow Meow's body before it stiffened. Within an hour, a simple ceremony commenced at the funeral home.

As the casket closed, the director requested final words for our beloved pet. My mother, who had cared for every family pet, choked back tears thanking Meow Meow for her 18 years of companionship while apologizing for any lack of care in Meow Meow's twilight. The weight of those words still resonates - my mother had lost her own mother just months before.

When human words failed to heal such a loss, I could only prayer over Meow Meow's soul and for our family's peace.

### What Lessons Did I Learn?

This process tested our family greatly as we balanced work, life and providing Meow Meow's intensive end-of-life care. Going it alone would have been unimaginable.

I'm reminded that no pet owner is perfect - despite my best efforts, I sometimes fell short when my own responsibilities overwhelmed me. But this journey reinforced that our beloved pets, too, will face death - and we must rise to the occasion with grace when that time comes.

### Will I Get Another Pet?

I'm not ready to think about another pet just yet - maybe in five years. I am not confident and not ready to become a good pet owner. For now, I'm focusing on supporting animal care NGOs.

### My Hope for the Future

* Every pet can have a peaceful end and owners are equipped with the knowledge and support they need
    
* Establishment of greater awareness and education about pet palliative care
    

> If you're considering adopting a pet, remember it's a lifetime commitment that requires readiness to provide care through all life stages.

*In loving memory of Meow Meow, who taught us the beauty of unconditional love and the challenge of saying goodbye. May her gentle spirit inspire us all to cherish every moment with our furry companions.*
