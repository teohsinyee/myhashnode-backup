### Topic: Excelling in the Workplace; Progressing in the Workplace

* The sermon began with a thought-provoking question: "**Who is the most successful corporate leader**?" Names like Elon Musk and Jack Ma echoed through the audience. However, Pr. Tim unveiled that King Solomon held this title.
    
* This revelation was truly eye-opening and inspired me to dig deeper into the wisdom of King Solomon.
    
* Pr. Tim, who transitioned from being a blue-collar worker at a multinational corporation to owning an F&B business, and now serving as a pastor, shared captivating stories from his journey.
    
* In one story, he recounted his promotion to a blue-collar role. With this promotion, the company granted him a special parking spot. He observed that this parking area was reserved for luxury cars, creating a contrast with his modest vehicle. **Despite suggestions to upgrade his car to match the prestige, he chose authenticity and parked in his regular spot.** This decision showcased his commitment to staying true to himself.
    
* Another compelling story focused on a team he led. The prevailing culture involved indulging clients with drinking and smoking. **However, he took a stand against this norm, demonstrating that equivalent results could be achieved without compromising personal values.** This choice led to transforming the team and its practices, despite facing criticism for his unconventional approach.
    
* These stories were deeply rooted in the principles of Romans 12:2.
    
    > **"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will isâ€”his good, pleasing, and perfect will."**
    
* Our pastor demonstrated the courage to uphold what is morally right, regardless of differing opinions.
    
* As recent graduates and entry-level employees, we are often recipients of policies. However, the shift to blue-collar roles provides us with greater opportunities to effect positive change. <mark>The focus isn't solely on climbing the corporate ladder but rather on the lasting impact we can have on the lives of others.</mark>
    
* The audience was encouraged to script their own stories, ones that resist conformity to worldly standards. These stories were divided into **four essential chapters**:
    
    1. **Godliness:** How do we stand up for righteousness?
        
    2. **Grace:** How do we display love and compassion towards others?
        
    3. **Generosity:** How do we extend generosity to those around us?
        
    4. **Gospel:** How do we share the message of the Gospel?
        
* Reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey, the pastor highlighted the vast contrast between the blue-collar and entrepreneurial worlds. He shared his experience of turning enemies into friends, a strategy that harmonized with his core values and facilitated smoother progress.
    
* As we journey in faith and professional growth, may our stories be ones of courage, authenticity, and the unwavering commitment to stand for what is right!
    

### Topic: How can I gain from pain?

* The question of why there is so much pain and suffering in the world is a complex one that has puzzled people for centuries. The Bible teaches that pain and suffering entered the world as a result of human sin and rebellion against God, and that we all have a tendency towards selfishness and self-gratification.
    
* Despite this, <mark>God has chosen not to control us like puppets, but to give us the freedom to make choices.</mark> This means that we are free to do good or bad, and that there will be consequences for our actions.
    
* Pain can serve as a warning sign that something is wrong, much like the warning light on a car dashboard. It can be a signal that we need to make changes in our lives in order to avoid further harm.
    
* In order to gain from our pain, we need to choose how we respond to it. We can either waste our pain or use it for good.
    
* One way to use our pain for good is to focus on its purpose. <mark>Pain can have a purpose, and if we understand that purpose, we may be able to bear it more easily.</mark> For example, the pain of childbirth has a purpose - to bring new life into the world.
    
* Another way to gain from our pain is to use it to <mark>draw closer to God in worship</mark>. This can involve spending time alone with God, telling Him how we feel, and even complaining to Him about our pain. The book of Psalms contains many examples of people doing this.
    
* We can also use our pain to <mark>draw closer to others in fellowship</mark>. This involves sharing our burdens with others and supporting one another through difficult times.
    
* Finally, we can use our pain to grow more like Jesus in discipleship. This means learning from our pain, changing our ways, and becoming more loving and compassionate towards others. Jesus himself learned obedience through suffering, and we can do the same.
    
* When we respond to our pain in these ways, we may find that it leads us closer to God and makes us more alive, concerned, sensitive, reverent, human, passionate, and responsible, as the verse from 2 Corinthians 7:11-13 suggests.
    

### Topic: Saved and Sured

* Repentance is indeed a gift of God, as it is God who grants us the grace to turn away from our sins and turn towards Him. However, it is important to note that God desires that all people repent and come to a knowledge of the truth (2 Peter 3:9), so we should not think that repentance is only given to a select few.
    
* Mercy is indeed a gift of God as well, and we cannot demand it from Him. However, God is also merciful and desires to show mercy to all who come to Him in faith.
    
* The idea of God electing sinners is a complex theological concept that has been debated throughout history. Some Christians believe in the idea of predestination, which holds that God chooses certain people for salvation before they are even born. Others believe that God desires for all people to be saved and that our free will plays a role in our salvation. Regardless of where you stand on this issue, it is important to remember that salvation ultimately comes from God, not from our own efforts.
    
* The story of Abraham is a powerful example of God's faithfulness to sinners. Abraham was far from perfect, but God chose to make a covenant with him and bless him and his descendants. <mark>This shows us that God's love and grace are not based on our own merits, but on His character and faithfulness</mark>.
    
* Finally, it is important to remember that salvation does not come from our own goodness or works. As the Apostle Paul wrote, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9). We cannot earn our way to heaven, but must rely on God's grace and mercy.
    

### Topic: Transform weakness into strength

* In order to transform our weaknesses into strengths, we must first be willing to <mark>acknowledge and pinpoint them</mark>. We cannot address what we do not acknowledge. As Proverbs 28:13 says, "Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy." Similarly, in 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, the apostle Paul writes about his own weakness and how he learned to boast in it, knowing that God's power is made perfect in weakness.
    
* Once we have identified our weaknesses, we can seek to understand <mark>how God wants to use them for His purposes</mark>. In 2 Corinthians 4:7, Paul writes, "But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us." Our weaknesses can be a means for God to display His power and glory through us. Similarly, in Romans 8:28, we are reminded that God works all things together for the good of those who love Him, including our weaknesses and struggles.
    
* When we are faced with weaknesses and struggles, we may be tempted to respond in negative ways, such as feeling useless or being self-destructive. However, <mark>God calls us to deal with our weaknesses in a productive and healthy way</mark>. In 1 Peter 5:6-7, we are encouraged to humble ourselves before God and cast our anxieties on Him, knowing that He cares for us. Similarly, in Philippians 4:13, Paul writes that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him.
    
* One of the ways that God uses our weaknesses for His purposes is by <mark>allowing us to help others who are going through similar struggles</mark>. In 2 Corinthians 1:3-4, Paul writes that God comforts us in our troubles so that we can comfort others with the comfort we have received from Him. Similarly, in Galatians 6:2, we are called to bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ.
    
* Finally, transforming weakness into strength requires us to embrace vulnerability. When we are willing to <mark>be honest about our weaknesses and struggles, we open ourselves up to God's grace and the support of others</mark>. In Hebrews 4:15-16, we are reminded that Jesus understands our weaknesses and invites us to approach His throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Similarly, in James 5:16, we are encouraged to confess our sins to one another and pray for each other, so that we may be healed.
    

### Topic: Living a Christ-Centered Life in a World of Uncertainty

* The verse from 2 Corinthians reminds us that the things of this world are temporary and fleeting, while the things of God are eternal and lasting. This means that <mark>we should not get too attached to the things of this world</mark>, but rather focus our hearts and minds on the things that really matter. This includes our relationship with God, our relationships with others, and the work that God has called us to do.
    
* Recognizing God's love for us is foundational to our Christian faith. It is only through the love of God that we are saved, and it is only through His grace that we are able to live a new life in Christ. Our response to this love should be one of gratitude and obedience. We should seek to love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love our neighbors as ourselves.
    
* Living a purposeful life means that we seek to align our goals and aspirations with God's will for our lives. This involves <mark>seeking His guidance and direction</mark>, and using our gifts and talents to serve Him and others. It also means being willing to make sacrifices and face challenges, knowing that God is with us every step of the way.
    
* Trusting in God's plan when we face suffering and challenges can be difficult, but it is important to remember that God is always in control. Even when things seem to be going wrong, He is still at work, and He can use our struggles and hardships for our good and His glory. This <mark>does not mean that we will always understand why things happen, but it does mean that we can trust in God's goodness and love even in the midst of pain and uncertainty</mark>. The story of Job is a powerful example of this.
    
* One of the things that sets Christianity apart from other religions is the emphasis on grace and faith. In Christianity, we do not need to earn God's love or blessings through our own efforts or sacrifices. Instead, <mark>we receive them as a gift of grace through faith in Jesus Christ.</mark> This means that our relationship with God is not based on what we do, but on what Christ has already done for us.
    

### Topic: Finding Joy and Purpose in Christ

* The statement "**For me to live is Christ, to die is gain**" is found in Philippians 1:21, where the apostle Paul writes, "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." Here, Paul is expressing his deep commitment to following Christ and his willingness to suffer for the sake of the gospel. He sees his life as being completely centered around Christ and his mission, and he is not afraid of death because he knows that it will bring him into the presence of God.
    
* The distinction between happiness and joy is important in the Christian life. While happiness is often based on external circumstances and can be fleeting, <mark>joy is an internal state of contentment and peace that comes from a deep relationship with God</mark>. This idea is expressed in James 1:2, which says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds." Christians can experience joy even in the midst of difficult circumstances because they have a firm hope in God and His promises.
    
* Pain, pressure, and difficult people can be joy-killers, but as Christians, we can choose to focus on the joy that comes from our relationship with God. This idea is expressed in Philippians 4:4, which says, "**Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!**" We can choose to find joy in God's presence and His promises, even when we are facing difficult circumstances.
    
* <mark>When we face problems, it is important to pray for the perspective to see them from God's point of view.</mark> This idea is expressed in Philippians 4:6-7, which says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." By bringing our problems to God in prayer, we can experience His peace and find the perspective we need to face our challenges.
    
* As Christians, we are called to <mark>conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ</mark>. This idea is expressed in Philippians 1:27, which says, "**Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ.**" We are called to put others first and to pray for them selflessly. This idea is expressed in Philippians 2:3-4, which says, "Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."
    
* It is a <mark>privilege to suffer for Christ</mark>, as it allows us to share in His sufferings and to draw closer to Him. This idea is expressed in Philippians 3:10, which says, "that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death."
    

### Topic: Reality of hell

* The existence of hell is a difficult and sobering reality to grapple with, but ultimately it stems from the fact that evil and sin exist in the world. God is Just and Holy, and must punish sin in order to maintain His justice and righteousness.
    
* The Bible describes hell as a place of eternal torment and separation from God. It is a place of darkness, weeping, and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 8:12). However, it is also important to <mark>remember that hell was not created for human beings, but for Satan and his demons</mark> (Matthew 25:41). God desires that all people come to repentance and receive salvation (2 Peter 3:9).
    
* Learning about the reality of hell should motivate us to take our faith and our responsibility to share the Gospel seriously. We should seek to live lives that are compelling and attractive to others, so that they may come to know Christ and avoid the fate of eternal separation from God.
    
* It is also important to recognize that our ultimate fate depends on the grace of God. <mark>We cannot earn our way into heaven through our own efforts or good deeds, but must rely on the mercy and love of God</mark>. This should instill a healthy fear in us, but also a deep sense of gratitude and humility.
    
* Finally, as Christians <mark>we should strive to care for others in the same way that Jesus cares for us</mark>. We should be motivated by a love for God and a desire to share His love and truth with others. This is our greatest responsibility and privilege as followers of Christ.

*Special notes:*  
I want to express my deep gratitude to my friend who introduced me to Christianity and encouraged me to learn more about God. This journey has been eye-opening and transformative, and I am excited to continue growing in my faith.

As I strive to live a life that honors God, I know that I will face many questions and challenges along the way. But I am committed to seeking answers and guidance through prayer, Scripture, and the wisdom of fellow believers. I look forward to what lies ahead, knowing that God is faithful and that His plans for me are good. ðŸ’“
