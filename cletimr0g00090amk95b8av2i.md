Welcome to my sharing series where I will be documenting my **final year of study at School of Computer Sciences of Universiti Sains Malaysia**, which has been the toughest period of my life so far.

Most people only see the bright side of others and don't realize the struggles that they may be going through. I want to change that by sharing my journey with you.

I want to show you the highs and lows, the victories and defeats, and everything in between. I hope that through my experiences, you will gain insight and inspiration to overcome your own challenges. So let's begin this journey together! 🥳

This month has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions and challenges. I have been struggling with self-doubt about participating in the campus election, but in the end, I decided to go for it. To my surprise, **I won the election without any contestants**. 🥳

However, my victory was short-lived as I **tested positive for Covid the next day** and had to quarantine for four days. 😭😭 Although I missed classes and was unable to make progress on my part-time jobs, I used this time to take a break and focus on my health.

After the quarantine period, my cough worsened, and I struggled to sleep. I had to take cough syrup and medication every day, and sometimes, I would cough until I vomited. Due to the chronic cough, I had to **isolate myself from people and even missed more classes**. It was a lonely period, and I missed my friends dearly. I struggled to eat and often went without food for a day, causing me to lose weight. 😭

Furthermore, I had to balance **my responsibilities towards the welfare of hundreds of computer science students**, which added to my already overwhelming stress levels. It was challenging, but I knew that I could not neglect these duties as they were crucial for the well-being of the students. 🥲🥲

To add to my worries, I **went for an X-ray to check my lung**, and it was diagnosed with **long Covid**! I met with three doctors, and they all said that there is nothing they can do for my condition, and some people took months or even years to recover.

**This news devastated me** as I did not know when I would recover from the cough or how long I would have to isolate myself from my loved ones. ☠️

All of this has affected my academic progress, and I have not made much progress on my FYP. **I feel lost and clueless about how to continue my journey after this**. My academic future is at stake, and I fear that I may not be able to achieve my goals.

### Month 2 (November 2022)

Academic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  
Relationship: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆  
Self-care: ⭐⭐☆☆☆

it has been an eventful month. I suspected that I had a hairline crack in my leg, which made it difficult for me to walk. I visited multiple clinics and went for X-rays to confirm my condition. Fortunately, the doctors confirmed that it was just a bruise, and I was relieved to hear this news. 😊🙌

Despite my injury, I was also **busy with the campus election**, working tirelessly day and night to prepare for it. I am grateful for my friends who have supported me through this challenging time, helping me with ad-hoc events, poster design, photography, and discussing my MPP blueprint. 💖💖

In mid-November, it was also the General Election day (GE 15) and I **went back to Ipoh to cast my vote**. It was a short break that allowed me to spend some quality time with my family, but the traveling did tire me out. 😅

Towards the end of November, things took a turn for the worse when I fell off my motorcycle and injured my hand. 🤕 Unfortunately, I did not have time to tend to my wound due to time constraints, and this added to the chaos of my already busy schedule.

**My day-to-day routine was like a rollercoaster ride, rushing from one place to another with no time for meals or rest.** As a result, I did not make much progress on my FYP, which is a source of concern for me. Despite all these challenges, I am determined to stay positive and focus on my goals!

### Month 1 (October 2022)

Academic: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
Relationship: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
Self-care: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

After two years of online distance learning, it was refreshing to be back on campus for face-to-face classes. I am grateful to have been allocated a hostel that is just a 5-minute walk from my school. The classes were enjoyable, and I even had the opportunity to deliver a sharing to the Computer Science freshies.

However, things started getting busy as I began preparing for the campus election. **I have always dreamt of being part of the student representative council and now, after a delay of two years due to the Covid situation**, I finally have the opportunity to run for the school constituency. With the power of being a student representative, I am determined to push for more initiatives that benefit the USM community.

In the midst of all this, I also managed to **submit my FYP (Final Year Project) proposal on time**. While I am glad to have met the deadline, I found myself staying up late more often than I would like to. 😅😅
