In life's journey, the imprints we leave on others' hearts define our legacy. Guided by the wisdom of Pr Timothy Loh, I set out to bring positive changes to my community. Since 2019, my first year at university, I've been committed to planting seeds of change. This article stands as evidence of those early efforts, with the intention of inspiring others on a similar path.

I've always aimed to **create a strong community that supports one another, even when individualism prevails**. During the challenges of Covid-19 and online learning, I saw myself as a student leader. I worked to connect students, even from afar. Alongside this, I've been devoted to training the next generation to willingly continue the tasks I've taken on. While my grand vision is a work in progress, I feel privileged to contribute to this transformative journey.
